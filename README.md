# ProxyImage

*This is my first GitHub project*

A image proxy server in express re-written in TypeScript from https://github.com/alexabrahall/image-proxy working for LuisaViaRoma and other infinite pending / redirect requests from sites.

Install required packages with `npm i` and run with `npm run dev`.

Suggestions and improvements are accepted!
